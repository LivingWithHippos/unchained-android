App to interact with [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) APIs.

### What is Real Debrid :question:

Real Debrid is a service to download files from hosting websites and the torrent network.
Files are downloaded directly on their servers that you can then use for your downloads.
They provide high speeds for a lot of services like Mega and RapidGator without needing 
all their premium accounts, and can also stream media files directly. 
**N.B. Real Debrid is a (cheap) paid service**

Contributions are welcome. You can use the [discussion tab](https://github.com/LivingWithHippos/unchained-android/discussions) to ask for help setting up the project. At the moment at least Android Studio 2021.1.1 is needed to build the project.

The dev branch is the one where the development happens, it gets merged into master when a release is ready.

A debug version is available, it reports automatically any crash information, it can be useful to help me debug errors.

This app is written in Kotlin and uses the following architectures/patterns/libraries:

MVVM architectural pattern, Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, Data Binding for managing ui-data relations, Navigation, Moshi, Retrofit, OkHTTP, Room, Coroutines, Flow, Livedata, Coil

The app is available in English, Italian and French, you can contribute to those or add a new language [here](https://localization.professiona.li/engage/unchained-for-android/) (much appreciated!)

There's a work in progress [wiki page](https://github.com/LivingWithHippos/unchained-android/wiki/Search-Engine) for creating search plugins.
