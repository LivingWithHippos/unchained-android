                          By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                          automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                          that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                          allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                          our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                          extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn\'t try
                          to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                          versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                          database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                          to it, still belong to LivingWithHippos.
                        </p> <p>
                          LivingWithHippos is committed to ensuring that the app is
                          as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                          reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                          its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                          charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                          clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                        </p> <p>
                          The Unchained app stores and processes personal data that
                          you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                          Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                          access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                          not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                          removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                          official operating system of your device. It could make your
                          phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                          compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                          that the Unchained app won’t work properly or at all.
                        </p> <!----> <p>
                          You should be aware that there are certain things that
                          LivingWithHippos will not take responsibility for. Certain
                          functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                          internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                          by your mobile network provider, but LivingWithHippos
                          cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                          functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                          have any of your data allowance left.
                        </p> <p></p> <p>
                          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                          should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                          mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                          be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                          the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                          other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                          responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                          charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                          (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                          you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                          using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                          received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                        </p> <p>
                          Along the same lines, LivingWithHippos cannot always take
                          responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                          make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                          battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                          LivingWithHippos cannot accept responsibility.
                        </p> <p>
                          With respect to LivingWithHippos’s responsibility for your
                          use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                          bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                          updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                          to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                          to you. LivingWithHippos accepts no liability for any
                          loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                          relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                        </p> <p>
                          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                          currently available on Android – the requirements for
                          system(and for any additional systems we
                          decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                          and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                          using the app. LivingWithHippos does not promise that it
                          will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                          and/or works with the Android version that you have
                          installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                          accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                          also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                          it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                          Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                          rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                          (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                          from your device.
                        </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                          I may update our Terms and Conditions
                          from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page

                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to

                  I want to inform you that whenever you

                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

                </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                  I may employ third-party companies and
                  individuals due to the following reasons:
                </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
                  I want to inform users of this Service
                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100%% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,

                  I do not knowingly collect personally
                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
